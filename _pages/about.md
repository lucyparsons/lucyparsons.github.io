## Who We Are

Lucy Parsons Labs is a collaboration between data scientists, transparency activists, artists, & technologists that operates in Chicago and the San Francisco Bay Area. We work at the intersection of digital rights and on-the-streets issues. Our main lines of work include providing digital security trainings, pursuing police accountability, researching the use of civil asset forfeiture, and filing public records requests.

## What We Do

Lucy Parsons Labs’ energies are dedicated to:

 + offering digital security trainings for activists and at-risk communities;
 + maintaining a secure system for whistleblowers to report misconduct via SecureDrop;
 + developing an open-source police misconduct reporting tool, OpenOversight;
 + reforming civil asset forfeiture programs, which incentivize heavy-handed policing;
 + filing public records requests under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and local equivalents.

Lucy Parsons Labs is a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit. EIN: 81-3046769


## Code of Conduct
###  Purpose

Lucy Parsons Labs is committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and religion (or lack thereof). Lucy Parsons Labs, as an organization, is strictly antiracist, antifascist, antihomophobic, antitransphobic, antimisogynistic, and antiableist.

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.
We invite all those who participate in our events & physical or online spaces to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

### Expected Behavior

   + Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
   + Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
   + Attempt collaboration before conflict.
   + Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
   + Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
   + Use content warnings when appropriate to do so - especially for depictions of violence. Failure to do so will be considered an inappropriate depiction of violence.


### Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions by any participant in our community, either physically or online, at all related events and in one-on-one communications carried out in the context of community business. 

Harassment includes: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images (including presentation slides); inappropriate depictions of violence; deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
Research that discusses topics of violence must use content warnings in order to not be considered inappropriate. 

Additionally, Lucy Parsons Labs prohibits the following:

   + Any speech or action that can be interpreted as supporting views which are white supremacist, fascist, nationalistic, misogynistic, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ageist or ableist.
   + Playing "devil's advocate" for any of the above listed viewpoints. 
   + Apologism to any of the above viewpoints or attempts to conflate "both sides" using the balance logical fallacy. 
   + Gaslighting & other forms of psychological manipulation
   + Using the Lucy Parsons Labs name for personal gain, profit, clout, or for non-organizational gain of reputation, fame, money, or power.

### Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior:

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including board members and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. 
Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.
If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).

### If You Witness or Are Subject to Unacceptable Behavior:

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a member of Lucy Parsons Labs as soon as possible. You can find a list of organizers to contact for each of the supporters of this code of conduct either in our slack channel, the list of our executive board, or our contributors list on our website. 

 In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress. Organizers of events are expected to announce the code of conduct at the start of the event and point out members of LPL who can be approached if the COC has been violated. 

### Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify one of the board members with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.

### Scope

We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues—online and in-person—as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.
