<h3> Who We Are?</h3>
The Lucy Parsons Labs is a Chicago-based collaboration between data scientists, transparency activists,
and technologists which focuses on the intersection of digital rights and on-the-streets issues.
The core group is made up of data scientists, sysadmins, and activists with a goal of merging these issues 
into a functional non-profit.   

<h3> What We Do </h3>
Our members have a variety of projects and collaborations in the works. Some examples we have include open FOIA projects into police spending, data analysis projects in Python, and some of our members have spoken at hacker conferences. We also support the Tor network, give trainings on security culture and enjoy mixing with journalists.

<h3> Our Mission </h3>
We are a transparency non-profit that seeks to engage our community in a horizontal manner while organizing around digital rights issues, supporting free and open source projects and seeking the free flow of information globally.
