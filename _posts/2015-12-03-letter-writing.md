Chicago, IL - The Lucy Parsons Lab recently sat down with activists, a cute dog, and friends to write letters to prisoners for the holidays. The LPL member compiled a list of prisoners and another friend host our event. So around a big kitchen table we wrote over forty letters and postcards to an array of prisoners.

Our list of [political prisoners](https://pad.riseup.net/p/U2nmEyP1sGAi) was populated with individuals like Jeremy Hammond, Jason Hammond, Barrett Brown, Chelsea Manning, members of the Angola 3, members of the MOVE 9 and many more. We also wrote to imprisoned animal rights and environmental activists, which the government represses under the power of the [national security state](https://theintercept.com/2015/07/28/dylan-roof-terrorist-animal-rights-activists-free-minks). The LPL made a conscious decision to write prisoners during the holidays, a time when prisoners may feel particularly far from friends and family.  

One of our long term goals is to do these events more frequently, at least on a monthly basis. If you're interested in joining us in the future, please get in touch. Solidarity to all prisoners.
