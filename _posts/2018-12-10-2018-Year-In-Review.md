## Donate to Lucy Parsons Labs to Support Our Work

Lucy Parsons Labs spent 2018 providing critical transparency and oversight and
are committed to continuing our efforts next year. We rely heavily on community
[donations](https://donorbox.org/donate-to-lucy-parsons-labs) to continue our
work. **The best way to support our work is to become a recurring
[donor](https://donorbox.org/donate-to-lucy-parsons-labs) in 2019.** Your
support has directly funded some of the work below.

### Transparency

In 2018, we sent over 500 public records requests. For example, we sent a
[request](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/foia-fbi-jon-burge-61298/)
to the FBI for documents related to the infamous police commander Jon Burge who
tortured hundreds of people while at the Chicago Police Department. We often
have to sue for records: just last week we filed a
[lawsuit](https://twitter.com/lucyparsonslabs/status/1069693989446651904)
against the City of Chicago for their “action plan” for their response to
protests related to the Jason Van Dyke trial.

We also strongly believe in community outreach and education. We hosted three
workshops to teach the public how to file their own public records requests. If
you were unable to attend, slides are available on our
[website](https://lucyparsonslabs.com/foiapresentation/index.html).

### Technology

We joined a brief at the Illinois Supreme Court that would protect Illinois’
biometrics privacy law. We obtained a manual that described a surveillance
company comparing its software to ‘[broken
windows](https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2018/jul/11/predpol-manual/)’
policing. Furthermore, we were the only group in Chicago to sue for the City’s
[bid](https://www.enewspf.com/latest-news/latest-local-news/lawsuit-seeks-full-records-of-chicagos-proposal-for-1-billion-amazon-hq2-bid/)
to lure Amazon, which would have offered Amazon billions of dollars in corporate
welfare. Finally, we continue to work with our friends at the Chicago Community
Bond Fund to launch their new [website](https://chicagobond.org/).

### Activism

We exposed the use of Berkeley Police’s
[controversial](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/14/berkeley-police-california-twitter-anti-fascist-protesters#img-1)
tactic of posting anti-fascist protesters’ mugshots on social media, which lead
to the community organizing and forcing the city to ban the practice. We
organized with community groups to halt a bill that would have given police in
Illinois
[warrantless](https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/police-drone-monitoring/Content?oid=49105404)
surveillance powers with drones. Finally, we joined the community to offer a
free [digital security](https://twitter.com/thotcon/status/1051292800870944768)
training at the Chicago Public Library, in addition to running several other
digital security training events around Chicago.

### Journalism

We wrote about about a CIA-backed firm pitching [social
media](https://shadowproof.com/2018/09/10/cia-backed-firm-touted-social-media-surveillance-of-students-to-sell-services-to-evanston-police/)
surveillance of students to Evanston Police. We exposed Evanston Police
Department’s [secret
drone](https://shadowproof.com/2018/09/13/evanston-police-crafted-secret-policy-drones/)
policies in a city that had previously banned drones. And we described an
Israeli lobbying group who monitors the far-right online with a history of
[monitoring
left-wing](https://unicornriot.ninja/2018/israel-lobby-group-monitors-neo-nazis-online-but-watches-leftists-too/)
groups.
