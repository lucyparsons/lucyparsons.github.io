Documents obtained by Lucy Parsons Labs under the Illinois Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
appear to confirm the US government is [aggressively investigating](https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21365448/blueleaks-dhs-distributed-denial-secrets-dds-ddosecrets-police) a journalism
non-profit as "criminal hackers" for publishing original reporting.

The documents, first obtained and published by the transparency non-profit
Distributed Denial of Secrets (DDoS), provide an intimate look into police
agencies and fusion centers across the country. Established after 9/11 to
disrupt terrorism plots, fusion centers have instead been challenged for massive
privacy and civil liberties violations. DDoS obtained over 270 gigabytes of data from
fusion centers and police departments and published the release in what it
billed the #BlueLeaks release.

Journalists and researchers immediately started combing through the BlueLeaks release to
reveal that police were obsessed with left-wing movements and ignoring
far-right [domestic extremism](https://theintercept.com/2020/07/15/george-floyd-protests-police-far-right-antifa/).
BlueLeaks further revealed that law enforcement inflated threats after the
police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis with some police stating, without evidence, that "Antifa"
would carry out [car bombings](https://theintercept.com/2020/06/26/blueleaks-minneapolis-police-protest-fears/).
This behavior is neither new nor surprising, as the gathering and dissemination of shoddy intelligence by fusion centers is [well documented](https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/10-3-2012%20PSI%20STAFF%20REPORT%20re%20FUSION%20CENTERS.2.pdf).

Nonetheless, authorities moved swiftly to crack down on DDoS's right to publish, first by [seizing its server](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/german-police-seize-blueleaks/)
in the middle of the night, presumably on behalf of the FBI. Homeland Security
Investigations (HSI), one of the largest agencies within DHS, questioned
unaffiliated individuals hosting an archives of the BlueLeaks and even [offered them money](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xg84ww/ice-questions-admin-of-the-eye-archive-site-hosted-blue-leaks) to become informants. The documents published this week by Lucy Parsons Labs [confirm](https://cdn.muckrock.com/foia_files/2020/08/10/CCSO_00000003.pdf) DHS considers DDoS "criminal hackers" and not journalists.


The government's aggressive push to name DDoS as "criminal hackers" is a
dangerous, unprecedented territory that criminalize everyone's right to publish
online under the First Amendment. Publishing information, even information
[obtained illegally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartnicki_v._Vopper), is
protected under the  First Amendment so long as the publisher does not
participate in illegal activity to gather the information. This right extends even to the
publishing of classified information, as the Supreme Court
[upheld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times_Co._v._United_States) in
the infamous case of the Pentagon Papers. (Almost all of the data published in
the BlueLeaks was
[unclassified](https://www.dla.mil/Portals/104/Documents/InformationOperations/LogisticsInformationServices/Customer%20Outreach/Subscriptions/J6_ForOfficialUseOnly_160113.pdf).)

The confirmation of an investigation by DHS's Office of Intelligence and
Analysis (I&A) reflects a growing pattern of DHS investigating journalists as
threats to national security. Just this month in Portland, I&A created "baseball cards" of
[journalists](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/01/dhs-removes-official-who-oversaw-intelligence-reports-on-journalists-390042),
a practice most commonly used by the military in hostile conflict situations. Other DHS
agencies have recently tracked
[media](https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/source-leaked-documents-show-the-us-government-tracking-journalists-and-advocates-through-a-secret-database/3438/)
at the US-Mexico border in secret databases. While HSI is thought to be the
government agency investigating DDoS, it is not uncommon for them to open
investigations on behalf of other agencies (such as the FBI) in order to hide the
existence of an official investigation. In the last few years, we have seen the
FBI using [secret rules](https://theintercept.com/2016/06/30/secret-rules-make-it-pretty-easy-for-the-fbi-to-spy-on-journalists/)
to open investigations on journalists through [national security letters](https://www.eff.org/issues/national-security-letters), which do
not require judicial review. As recently as 2018, the Freedom of the Press
Foundation revealed the existence of a _separate_ secret channel for
investigation on media organizations through [secret FISA court orders](https://freedom.press/news/revealed-justice-depts-secret-rules-targeting-journalists-fisa-court-orders/).

Our documents published today reveal a troubling criminalization of
journalism by the alphabet boys that constitute the national security state.
