Across the country we are witnessing widespread demonstrations and an outpouring
of solidarity. Lucy Parsons Labs has been hard at work to meet the moment.

Caravans of cars and tens of thousands of protestors have been hitting the
streets in the last few weeks demanding justice for George Floyd, Breonna
Taylor, Laquan McDonald, and an untold number of victims of police violence. We
are also seeing an unprecedented wave of repression: violent police riots,
[harassment of
protestors](https://wtop.com/dc/2020/06/dc-national-guard-will-investigate-why-its-helicopters-were-used-to-suppress-protests/)
with tear gas and military helicopters, FBI [intimidation of
activists](https://theintercept.com/2020/06/12/fbi-jttf-protests-activists-cookeville-tennessee/),
and mass arrests. In response, members of LPL are providing technical
infrastructure to the Chicago Community Bond Fund and other mass defense
efforts, sitting for hours waiting to support those arrested, and raising funds
for activists on our [Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/lucyparsonslabs).

At the same time, Lucy Parsons Labs is continuing to [educate
activists](https://themarkup.org/ask-the-markup/2020/06/04/how-do-i-prepare-my-phone-for-a-protest)
on the dangers of police surveillance. We are updating our [Police Surveillance
Primer](https://redshiftzero.github.io/policesurveillance/) this summer. Lucy
Parsons Labs has also organized a
[coalition](https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2020/2/4/21122568/lightfoot-urged-pull-plug-facial-recognition-technology)
against the use of facial recognition technology. We are happy to announce that
our work has
[halted](https://www.dailyherald.com/article/20200529/news/305299907) Chicago
Police's use of Clearview AIâ€™s facial recognition software.

Building on our previous work, we have seen an influx of volunteers eager to
demand change, as well as a rise in contributions to our database of police
officer images, [OpenOversight](https://openoversight.com/). Our members have
sent a surge of Freedom of Information Act requests to learn more about the
police's aggressive response to the recent protests. We remain engaged with our
community, partners, friends, and allies so we can deliver the tools they need
to meet the moment. Black Lives Matter.
