Lucy Parsons Labs, in collaboration with local journalist Joel Handley and the
Chicago Reader, has published an investigation of the use of civil asset
forfeiture by Chicago Police. In the story, which you can [read in full on 
the Chicago Reader's
site](http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/police-department-civil-forfeiture-investigation/Content?oid=23728922), we show how Chicago Police seize millions from
citizens not necessarily convicted or even charged with a crime. We also show how they use this
money to fund the operations of their narcotics units and buy controversial surveillance
equipment. 

We'll be continuing to request expenditures to keep track of how Chicago Police
are using asset forfeiture monies, and updating our data which you can see here:
