## Who We Are
The Lucy Parsons Labs is a charitable Chicago-based collaboration between data scientists, transparency activists, and technologists which focuses on the intersection of digital rights and on-the-streets issues. The core group is made up of data scientists, system administrators, and activists with a goal of merging these issues into a functional non-profit.

## What We Do
Our members have a variety of educational projects and collaborations in the works. Some examples include our open FOIA projects investigating police spending and data analysis projects in Python. We also support the Tor network, give trainings on security culture and enjoy mixing with journalists.

## Our Mission
We are a transparency non-profit that seeks to engage our community in a horizontal manner while organizing around digital rights issues, supporting free and open source projects and seeking the free flow of information globally.
